<code>attach<\/code> and\n<code>onComplete<\/code>.<br />\nIf you implement your own SceneTransition, you're required to invoke\n<code>Callback#onComplete<\/code> when the transition has finished.\nIf you fail to do this, the system may fail to execute future Scene transitions.<\/p>\n<p>The <code>Callback#attach<\/code> function can be invoked <em>during<\/em> the transition, and\nattaches the ViewController to the Scene before the transition has ended.\nThis can be useful if your Scene needs to populate the View with certain data\nand doing this only after the transition has finished leads to unwanted\n'popping' results.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"meaningful-transitions\">Meaningful transitions<\/h2>\n<p>Creating meaningful transitions can greatly enhance the user experience of

window cause the Activity to be\ndestroyed and re-created.<br />\nThe Android system also provides several methods on the Activity class to\nbe able to navigate to different Activities, using <code>Activity.startActivity<\/code>\nor <code>Activity.startActivityForResult<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Next to this, when an Activity is stopped it is able to save its instance state\nso it can be restored

Navigator\ninstance providing the applications navigational state.\nThis instance needs to be shared across Activity instances, to ensure\nconfiguration changes don't cause the navigational state to

<code>onSaveInstanceState<\/code> method is invoked by the system, it\nneeds to save the Navigator's state with it.\nThe NavigatorProvider interface also exposes a\n<code>saveNavigatorState():

href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Container\">Container<\/a> state (or view state) saving and restoring is a very\nimportant topic for mobile applications.\nWhenever a user has entered text or scrolled a list to a particular position and\nnavigates away from the screen to later return again, it is expected that the\nentered text or the scroll position is still there.<\/p>\n<p>Next to saving their own state, Scenes are also responsible for saving and\nrestoring the Container states.\nSince multiple Containers can be attached to and detached from the Scene, their\nstate needs to be saved and restored between the Container instances as well.\nThis can easily be done by saving the Container state in the <code>detach<\/code> method,\nand restoring it in the <code>attach<\/code> method.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, when saving the Scene state, the most recent container state needs to\nbe persisted as well.\nThe <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/BasicScene\">BasicScene<\/a> class provides a base implementation that\nhandles all this.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"in-acorn\">In Acorn<\/h2>\n<p>By default, a <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Scene\">Scene<\/a> does not support state saving, nor does it\nsave or restore view hierarchy state such as user input or scroll positions.\nFrom a user's perspective however, it is important that you <em>do<\/em> save your\nScene's state: not only can an Android application be killed at any time after which it\nshould be properly restored, but a lost scroll position on orientation change\ncan also be very annoying.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"view-hierarchy-state-saving\">View hierarchy state saving<\/h3>\n<p>During the lifetime of a <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Scene\">Scene<\/a> it can happen that it receives\nmultiple calls to <code>attach<\/code> and <code>detach<\/code>.\nOften, subsequent calls to <code>attach<\/code> will have fresh instances of the\n<a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Container\">Container<\/a> passed to it, losing any view hierarchy state.\nThe Activity being recreated due to a device orientation change is one example\nof this.<\/p>\n<p>The Scene can save and restore the container state between these subsequent\ncalls to <code>attach<\/code> if the Container type implements the\n<a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/RestorableContainer\">RestorableContainer<\/a> interface.\nThis interface provides a <code>saveInstanceState<\/code> method and a\n<code>restoreInstanceState<\/code> method, which the Scene can use to restore the container\nstate:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span><\/span><a name=\"line-1\"><\/a><span

A change in its Scenes is not propagated to its\nlisteners.<\/li>\n<li>'started'  : The Navigator is currently active, and changes in scenery are\npropagated to the listeners.<\/li>\n<li>'destroyed': The Navigator is destroyed and will not become active anymore.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>During the lifetime of a Navigator it can go from 'stopped' to 'started' and\nvice versa multiple times, until it reaches the 'destroyed' state.<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span><\/span><a name=\"line-1\"><\/a><span class=\"lineno\">1&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"k\">interface<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"nc\">Navigator<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"p\">{<\/span><br><a name=\"line-2\"><\/a><span class=\"lineno\">2&nbsp;<\/span><br><a name=\"line-3\"><\/a><span class=\"lineno\">3&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"k\">fun<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"nf\">onStart<\/span><span class=\"p\">()<\/span><br><a name=\"line-4\"><\/a><span class=\"lineno\">4&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"k\">fun<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"nf\">onStop<\/span><span class=\"p\">()<\/span><br><a name=\"line-5\"><\/a><span class=\"lineno\">5&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"k\">fun<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"nf\">onDestroy<\/span><span class=\"p\">()<\/span><br><a name=\"line-6\"><\/a><span class=\"lineno\">6&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"p\">}<\/span><br><\/pre><\/div><br>\n<h3 id=\"state-modelling\">State modelling<\/h3>\n<p>Navigator implementations are free to choose how they implement their internal\nstate.\nFor example, it could use a structure like a stack to provide functionality\nsimilar to a back stack, or it could use a state machine for the state\nrepresentation.<\/p>\n<p>This freedom that the Navigator gets also means that it is free to choose how\nthe lifecycles of its Scenes behave, as long as it is according to the Scene\nspecification. The order of the Scene's callback methods must honored, and the\nNavigator's lifecycle state must always outlive that of a Scene.\nThis means that a Navigator's Scenes may only be active when the Navigator is\nactive, and no Scenes may be active when the Navigator is inactive.\nFinally, the Scenes must always be properly destroyed when the Navigator is\ndestroyed.<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, the Navigator implementation is free to decide how its Scene's\nlifecycle is structured, and often depends on the strategy that is chosen for\nmodelling the internal state.<\/p>\n<p>A Navigator that uses a stack for its state for example will stop but not\ndestroy the currently active Scene when a new Scene is pushed on the Stack.\nScenes are only destroyed when they're popped off the stack or when the Navigator\nis destroyed.\nA Navigator that merely replaces Scenes without any 'back' behavior will\nimmediately stop and destroy the currently active Scene when a new Scene becomes\nactive.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"scene-propagation\">Scene propagation<\/h3>\n<p>The Navigator implementation is in control of determining which Scene is active,\nand must propagate it to any listeners.\nThe Navigator interface declares a\n<a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/navigation/Navigator/Events\">Navigator.Events<\/a> interface that contains\ncallback methods to trigger interested parties.\nThe Navigator interface itself has a method to let these interested parties\nregister themselves:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span><\/span><a

interesting in handling these back presses.\nSince the Activity is the entry point for back presses, it should delegate\nthis request first to the Navigator if possible.\nThe Navigator can use this event to make a transition in its internal state.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"navigator-results\">Navigator results<\/h3>\n<p>A Navigator implementation can also provide a callback interface to publish\nresults.\nThis is useful for example when creating a login flow: the user can be guided\nthrough several Scenes, after which the Navigator finishes with an auth token\nresult.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to implement callbacks for Navigator results.\nThe first is similar to the way this is implemented for Scenes, by passing a\ncallback to the Navigator constructor:<\/p>\n<div

instance is responsible for the restoration of the\nScenes as well.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the chosen strategy for modelling the internal navigation state,\nthe Navigator must be able to restore one or more of its Scenes and restore its\ninternal state as well.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"navigator-composition\">Navigator composition<\/h3>\n<p>The power behind the Navigator interface is that instances can be

then tied together using a composing Navigator.<\/p>\n<p>These composing Navigators can decide their internal state just as the 'normal'\nNavigators, which means that you can create a Navigator implementation that can\npush and pop other Navigators on and off a stack.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"advanced-topics\">Advanced topics<\/h2>\n<p>Usually you don't need to implement the Navigator interface

href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Scene\">Scenes<\/a> in its stack.\nWhenever a second Scene is stacked upon the initial Scene, both the initial\nScene and the second Scene will <em>simultaneously<\/em> be in their 'started' states,\nhereby differing from navigators such as the <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/navigation/StackNavigator\">StackNavigator<\/a>\nwhich only allow a single Scene in the 'started' state.<\/p>\n<p>This Navigator can come in useful when implementing complex overlays that\nwarrant their own Scene instance:<\/p>\n<p class=\"image-preview\"><img src=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/wiki/experimental/media/overlay_example.gif\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n<p><em>A 'complex overlay' here means an overlay that is <em>not<\/em> a simple dialog.\nThe ConcurrentPairNavigator allows for great flexibility to define your layout\nand its transitions perfectly, but comes with a fair amount of overhead.\nIf you want to display a simple dialog showing a message or asking a question,\nuse an AlertDialog instead.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"usage\">Usage<\/h2>\n<p><em>You can find a working sample project demonstrating usage of this class\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nhaarman/Acorn/tree/master/samples/hello-concurrentpairnavigator\">here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>To be able to allow two <a

href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/navigation/experimental/ConcurrentPairNavigator\">ConcurrentPairNavigator<\/a> wraps the two Scenes in a\n<a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/navigation/experimental/CombinedScene\">CombinedScene<\/a> instance with the key of the second Scene.\nThis special Scene implementation ignores any lifecycle calls, and ensures both\nScenes receive the proper <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/presentation/Container\">Container<\/a> instances in <code>attach<\/code> and\n<code>detach<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>It does this by accepting a special <a href=\"https://nhaarman.github.io/acorn/com/nhaarman/acorn/navigation/experimental/CombinedContainer\">CombinedContainer<\/a>\nspecialization of the Container interface, which allows access to the two sub\nContainers.\nIt is then the responsibility of the UI layer to properly provide instances of\nthe CombinedContainer interface.<\/p>\n<p>In the following sections you can find out how to make use of the\nConcurrentPairNavigator.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-initial-scene\">The initial Scene<\/h3>\n<p>The <a

id=\"providing-the-layouts\">Providing the layouts<\/h3>\n<p>Now this is where things get tricky and a bit cumbersome.\nAs with all Scenes, there are three use cases to support when displaying their\nlayouts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Displaying as part of a Scene transition from the <em>first<\/em> to the <em>second<\/em> Scene;<\/li>\n<li>Displaying as part of a Scene transition from the <em>second<\/em> to the <em>first<\/em> Scene;<\/li>\n<li>Displaying from scratch, for example when a fresh Activity appears.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Usually when creating a Scene you can cover both of these by providing a simple\nViewController, for example using the ProvidesView interface.\nThe second use case is automatically covered by a default transition which\nreplaces the entire layout with the new one.\nFor the first Scene this is also the case.<br />\nIn the case of a CombinedScene however, using ProvidesView for the second\nScene isn't gonna cut it: the second Scene's layout is only a subset of the\nactual layout that needs to be shown. In our example case this would be the\ncard at the bottom of the view.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore all these use cases need to be handled manually.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"--the-viewcontroller\">- The ViewController<\/h4>\n<p>First though, we need to provide a ViewController implementation.\nIn this case we implement the CombinedContainer implementation:<\/p>\n<div

<em>second<\/em> Scene<\/h4>\n<p>This is the case the user will see most of the time, when you call\nConcurrentPairNavigator#push with your second Scene instance.\nWhen this happens, the navigator will transition from the  <code>FirstScene<\/code> instance\nto a CombinedScene instance.\nThis CombinedScene takes the <code>key<\/code> from the <code>SecondScene<\/code>, so this can be used\nto define a transition animation.<\/p>\n<p>This transition animation can be implemented as any other transition animation.\nThe only difference is that you don't remove the first Scene's layout at the
