/**
 * An abstract basic [Scene] implementation that provides commonly used
 * functionality.
 *
 * This class provides an [attachedView] property which provides the currently
 * attached [V] instance, if available.
 *
 * If the [Container] type [V] implements [RestorableContainer], this class
 * will save and restore the view state between subsequent calls to [attach] and
 * [detach].
 *
 * This class is able to save and restore its instance state in
 * [saveInstanceState], but does not implement [SavableScene] itself.
 * You can opt in to this state saving by explicitly implementing the
 * [SavableScene] interface.
 *
 * @param V The view type for this [Scene]. Can implement [RestorableContainer]
 * to save and restore view state between different views attached to the Scene.
 * @param savedState A previous saved state instance for this [Scene] as
 * returned by [saveInstanceState]. May be `null`.
 * @constructor Creates a new [BasicScene], restoring view state when
 * available.
